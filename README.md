## Known Bugs
You might see this error when installing node packages: `npm ERR! cb() never called!`

The version of Node installed on your machine, or the npm version, may be out of date for current Angular2 dependencies (more than likely it's zone.js).

### Try these steps
#### Update Node (_run with sudo if needed_)
1. `npm cache clean -f`
2. `npm install -g n`
3. `n stable`

#### Update npm
`npm install npm@latest -g`

Try running `npm install` again!
